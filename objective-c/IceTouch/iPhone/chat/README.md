This demo is an iPhone client for the
[ZeroC Chat Demo](https://www.zeroc.com/chat/index.html). This demo
connects to a single chat room, allowing you to chat with other chat
room participants.

By default, the demo connects to a chat server hosted on
demo.zeroc.com. The server accepts both secure and non-secure
connections through Glacier2. You may use any user name and password
when connecting.

If you would like to run your own server, or are otherwise interested
in the Chat Demo, the complete source is available
[here](https://www.zeroc.com/chat/download.html)
